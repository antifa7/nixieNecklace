# nixieNecklace
nixie necklace on the cheap using IN-19 tubes and disposable camera flash circuit components.

Here is the working file where I will be listing components and instructions on how to make this necklace.

Until I find out what brand and model specifically you want to use, the cameras that work the best either are the ones with only one transistor on the board, do not have any SMD components and hace a smaller transformer with 5 or six pins. I have seen some with 8 pins and have a larger package and footprint. The transformer is 8mm x 9mm x 9 mm high. The transistor has the marking 2SD2470 and I've seen some with D965. The diode is black. Some flashes only have one diode and others I have seen have two. When a second one is present, it is glass. You don't want that.
